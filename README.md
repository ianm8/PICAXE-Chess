# PICAXE-Chess
This is a small chess program for PIXACE X2 microcontrollers. Plays most chess moves including pawn promotion but does not generate en passant or castling. The program always plays black. I/O via USB serial terminal. Many thanks to Ã“scar (http://nanochess.org) for inspiration and creating some great chess programs!
